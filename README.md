# Free Code Camp: Responsive Web Design
## Project 1: Build a Tribute Page

**Objective**: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.

### Thoughts
While I know a little bit of JavaScript, I decided to use only HTML and CSS as these are the topics covered by FCC so far.

I have some experience with HTML and CSS from years ago when I used to design custom MySpace themes for friends, and profiles for people on GaiaOnline (hi to anyone who used to frequent *Personalized Graphics* between 2007-2010!)

I am making my way through **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)** which is an amazing free resource for people starting on their web developer journey.

### Resources Used
The font is **[Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono)**
